1) Firstly written the dockerfile and dockerignore file (not necessary here but for good practise).
2) Only the gradio_dashboard.py is the main app so created its requirements seperately for easy access.
3) To build image: (after doing -> cd A:\Project\book_recommender)
    docker build -t book-recommender .
    docker run -p 7860:7860 book-recommender
4) After finding huge image size (10GB) found it is unintentionally pulling PyTorch with CUDA (GPU) support, 
which brings massive NVIDIA CUDA libraries
5) Updated dockerfile and requirements-docker.txt
6) docker image prune -a (to delete image without container)
7) Wriring proper versions in requirements-docker.txt
8) Running on localhost:7860
9) To stop: 
    If not in detached mode -> CTRL + C
    Otherwise, new terminal> docker ps> docker stop <id/name>
